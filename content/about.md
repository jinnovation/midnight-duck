I'm Jonathan Jin[^1]. I'm the "lead" advisor at Midnight Duck.

I am a machine learning engineer with a specialization in platform and
infrastructure. I have helped build and scale ML infrastructure at large
organizations such as Spotify, NVIDIA, and Twitter. I have nearly ten years of
experience as a professional software engineer.

I was born in Chicago and raised in Beijing. I am now based in NYC.
