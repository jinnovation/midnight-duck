# Services

We provide a mixture of the following services to our clients.

## Engineering Advisory

Think of me as your "fractional tech lead." You and I will work together to
evaluate your technical goals and chart a path to success. Together, we will
craft a roadmap, define realistic but ambitious delivery milestones, and execute
on that plan to deliver on your goals. I will be there with you every step of
the way to help adjust the course in response to new priorities, unexpected
curveballs, or if **ðŸ’© just hits the fan**.

### Example scenarios

- "I have a prototype that I really want to get production-ready, but I'm not
  sure how"
- "I have a long-term vision for my product but I'm not sure how to get there"

### Concrete tasks

In this capacity, you might rely on me for any of the following:

- Foundational technical decisions, e.g. "how should we orchestrate our model
  training pipelines?" or "what cloud platform should we use?"
- Review of product requirements documents, architectural design proposals, and other
  similar technical documentation
- Early-stage proofs-of-concept or prototypes to validate technical feasibility
  of approaches before committing to them
