# Services

This page lists services that I provide to my clients. If there's something you
need that isn't called out here -- ask! I will happily work with you to decide
what works best for you.

## Ad-Hoc Consultation

Loosely structured conversations where we talk through some of your AI/ML
challenges and discuss potential solutions.

These are best for if you have some high-level architectural challenge that
you're not *quite* sure how to address. These are also useful for when you have
AI/ML needs, but are not yet at the scale at which hiring a dedicated AI/ML
engineer is feasible or practical.

### Example scenarios

- "We want to begin investing in machine learning. What should we prioritize
  first?
- "We have a model serving pipeline that we'd like to harden but don't want to
  invest in interviewing and hiring a full-time MLE. What should we do first?"
- "What are some paid or open-source solutions out there we should look into?"

## Engineering Advisory

Think of me as your "fractional tech lead." You and I will work together to
evaluate your technical goals and chart a path to success. Together, we will
craft a roadmap, define realistic but ambitious delivery milestones, and execute
on that plan to deliver on your goals. I will be there with you every step of
the way to help adjust the course in response to new priorities, unexpected
curveballs, or if **ðŸ’© just hits the fan**.

In this capacity, you might rely on me for any of the following:

- Foundational technical decisions, e.g. "how should we orchestrate our model
  training pipelines?" or "what cloud platform should we use?"
- Review of product requirements documents, architectural design proposals, and other
  similar technical documentation
- Early-stage proofs-of-concept or prototypes to validate technical feasibility
  of approaches before committing to them

### Example scenarios

- "I have a prototype that I really want to get production-ready, but I'm not
  sure how"
- "I have a long-term vision for my product but I'm not sure how to get there"
